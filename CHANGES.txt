See Ringo tracker on bitbucket for more feature requests!

The following list is only an incomplete reminder. Items here should be moved
to the tracker.

- Send notification mail when a new user registers a new account.
- Send notification mail when a new user confirms the new account.

0.11.2
------
- Splitted requirements. Required packages for testing are now installed
  locally.
- Added unittests to test /lib/helpers
- Added unittests to test /views/index
- Enhanced Profile modul. Added gender field. Make some fields desired and required.
- Added "multiple" attribute to Listfield Renderer. Allows the restrict the
  selection of items to one item at once. Only implemented on client side.
- Add support for list elements while accessing a "." separated
  attributes in the __getattribute__ method of the BaseItem.
- Add relation from tags to modules to allow modul specifc keywords.
- Add tags to forms.
- Add comments to forms.
- Ported "filter" attribute of selectionfield renderer to the listfield renderer.

0.11.1
------
- #36: Another try to fix caching problems. This is another approach to
  5c152bd which tried to disable the caching at gets lost. (maybe a merge
  error)

0.11.0
------
- Add service under "rest/rule/evaluate" to evaluate rules. Service is used
  for client side evaluation of rules in the formulars.
- Provide the user roles as "_roles" value in the form. This value can be used
  to model role based rules in the form. Form needs a hidden field which takes
  the provided "_roles".
- Removed category from form form and table configuration. It is currently
  unused.
- Changed rendering of ringo specif dropdown.
- Add option to configure group and owner inhertinace on creating new
  instances in the Owned-Mixin.
- Deletion of Items now cascades to Logs, Comments, Versions and nested
  Elements.
- #18: Added some ringo artwork.
- #8: Make documentation available in the application

0.10.0
------
- Add new requirement of py3o.template library.
- Add Printtemplate modul. Printtemplates are ODT or ODS documents which are
  used as templates for generating nice looking documents. On processing the
  template placeholders in the template will be replaced by values of the
  item. The template can include basic python expressions. E.g to iterate over
  lists.
- Add Printable Mixin. Inheriting from this mixin will add a print action to
  the item.
- Fixes on permission checks. Add button to add new items in listing only if
  the user actually has permission to add new items.
- Add "showsearch", "hideadd", "nolinks" attributes to listfield renderer to
  enhance configuration of rendering.
- Render permissions of a role as FieldList.
- Add TodolistRenderer. Render todos in the home view.

0.9.2
-----
- Add Versioned mixin. This mixin can be used to store different versions of
  an item. On each update of the item the serialized values of the item will
  be saved in the version table. The versions are later used to show
  differences between the current and a given prior version in the form.
- Add get_values function to the BaseItem to return a dictionary containing
  all values of the item. Optionally the items can be serialized (this
  is a very simple serialisation).
- Reorganised automatic logging and changing states. The former version was
  implemented as update handler in the mixin classes and was based
  on the SQLAlchemy "history" functionallity. Unfortunately this history
  wasn't as much reliable as expected in some corner cases. The update handler
  was removed and changing the states and logging are now implemented directly
  in the save method of the item.

0.9.1
-----
- Replaced route_url with route_path.
- Fixed rendering of links in the dropdown renderer. Consider user permission
  on link generation (read/update).
- Added options to the Table renderer to configure the responsive behaviour of
  table columns. You can now define which columns should be visible on which
  screenwidth. Defaults to show only the first column.
- Workded on Formeditor. Implemented selecting a form when creating new
  (blobform) items.
- Introduced warnings (formbar 393:bbd7a5192e29). Validate the item on loading
  to generate warning.
- Handlers in the statemachine now get the transition as additional parameter.
  This is usefull das the transformation gives access to the state,
  statemachine and optionally the request.
- Use sorting configuration from table config in DTLists.
- Added paginated DTList.
- Check if the user is still allowed to edit the item after he edited it
  (Statechange). If not call alternative read URL.
- Improved performance. Do some caching here and there.

0.9.0
-----

	- Write save method for items like the save method of formbar.
	  Overwrite the method in Blobforms.
	- Overwrite get_attr, get_value method in blobform to handle getting
	  values from the datafield.

	  this is hardcoded on itemlevel which form should be used.

- Implement simple Import and Export. Only single items. No relations.
	- Added JSON Importer and Exporter
	- Added import and export functions in the view for ringo modules

- Improved documentation
- Some fixes in the basic scaffold. Improved alembic integration.

0.8.0
-----

- Worked on caching the result of SQL queries to improbe the performance.
- API Change: BaseLists are not initialized with request instead of request.db

0.7.0
-----
- Added news modul
- Use "width" from tableconfig also in DTListings.
- Rows in DTLists are now clickable to if the user is allowed to update the
  item then the update action will be called on click. Else call the read action.
- Fix URLs for the ReST-Api to match basically the typical URL Schema for CRUD
  actions:

    * GET /items - Retrieves a list of items
    * GET /items/12 - Retrieves a specific item
    * POST /items - Creates a new item
    * PUT /items/12 - Updates item #12
    * PATCH /items/12 - Partially updates item #12
    * DELETE /items/12 - Deletes #12

  Note, that not all actions are actually implemented yet, but for now the url
  schema has beed adapted.

- ListingFieldRenderer
      When using listing in context with Nested Objects to build
      hirachies then take care to only show valid items in the list to
      prevent building broken hirachies.
    - Handle "onlylinked" config var in FieldListRenderer.
    - Handle "ignore" config var in FieldListRenderer.
