0.8.0
-----
- Added log modul
- Added statemachines
- Added simple mechanism to call handlers for certain events in the model.
  This is currently used to:
	- Update the updated attribute on every change of a item which has the
	  meta mixin.
	- Create a simple log entry on updating or creating a item.
- Worked on caching the result of SQL queries to improbe the performance.
- API Change: BaseLists are not initialized with request instead of request.db
- Added alembic folders to basic scaffold
- Worked on documentation

0.7.0
-----
- Added news modul
- Use "width" from tableconfig also in DTListings.
- Rows in DTLists are now clickable to if the user is allowed to update the
  item then the update action will be called on click. Else call the read action.
- Fix URLs for the ReST-Api to match basically the typical URL Schema for CRUD
  actions:

    * GET /items - Retrieves a list of items
    * GET /items/12 - Retrieves a specific item
    * POST /items - Creates a new item
    * PUT /items/12 - Updates item #12
    * PATCH /items/12 - Partially updates item #12
    * DELETE /items/12 - Deletes #12

  Note, that not all actions are actually implemented yet, but for now the url
  schema has beed adapted.
